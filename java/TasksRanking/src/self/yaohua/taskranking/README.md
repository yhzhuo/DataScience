<h3>Why it's useful?</h3>
<!-- Explain why as a young man figuring priority is important. -->
<h3>How it works?</h3>
<p>
<!-- Explain the algorithm and include the Math formula. -->

<h3>How comes the values?</h3>
<p>
The values of revenues of Goals, costs of Tasks, and impacts of each task on each goal come from the World's most advanced 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network" target="_blank">Neural Network</a> model -- 
my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain" target="_blank">HUMAN BRAIN</a>!
<br>
I tend to set values of revenues and costs within [0, 10], and values of impacts within [0, 1] based on my own judgement of
importance of Goals, hardship of Tasks, and relationships between them.
<br>
The values themselves are meaningless, but it helps me to make comparison between them. So when I'm overwhelmed by objectives, 
I can figure out my priorities very quick by only compare and adjust the revenues, costs, and impacts.

<h3>How it changes my life?</h3>
<p>
I formed the habit of making daily plan everyday long long ago. But sometimes things get out of my expectations as I make plans 
without figuring out my priorities. But now, by reading results of TasksRanking while making daily plan, I never feel stress even
a lot of objectives coming to my life concurrently! As a lover of Math, I'm so happy to see my loved Math helps me everyday!!!
