<h1>Introductions to TasksRanking Algorithm</h1>
<h2>And how it guides my daily life!</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>
<!-- Explain why as a young man figuring priority is important. -->
TasksRanking is a simple Mathmatical model that ranks tasks based on their priorities.<br>
Firstly, TasksRanking calculates the profit of tasks by the the cost of each task, revenue of each goal, what goals each task impacts, and how intense each task impact each goal.
Then, TasksRanking regards tasks with high profit as high priorities, and reversely sort tasks by their profit.

Pretty simple and amazing right? This means as a young man my priorities are:<br>
1. Ensure quality and speed of each task at my company<br>
2. Talk more with team members about their tasks<br>
3. Date girls<br>
4. Learn cooking<br>
5. Attend social activities<br>
6. Always read social information<br>

<h3>How it works?</h3>
<p>
<!-- Explain the algorithm and include the Math formula. -->
</p>
<h3>How comes the values?</h3>
<p>
The values of revenues of Goals, costs of Tasks, and impacts of each task on each goal come from the World's most advanced 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network" target="_blank">Neural Network</a> model -- 
my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain" target="_blank">HUMAN BRAIN</a>!
<br>
I tend to set values of revenues and costs within [0, 10], and values of impacts within [0, 1] based on my own judgement of
importance of Goals, hardship of Tasks, and relationships between them.
<br>
The values themselves are meaningless, but it helps me to make comparison between them. So when I'm overwhelmed by objectives, 
I can figure out my priorities very quick by only compare and adjust the revenues, costs, and impacts.
</p>
<h3>How it changes my life?</h3>
<p>

In my real life, I have 19 goals and 41 tasks in total. I really could not figure out my priority easily and make daily plan. So TasksRanking helps me!<br>
I formed the habit of making daily plan everyday long long ago. But sometimes things get out of my expectations as I make plans 
without figuring out my priorities. But now, by reading results of TasksRanking while making daily plan, I never feel stress even
a lot of objectives coming to my life concurrently! As a lover of Math, I'm so happy to see my loved Math helps me everyday!!!
